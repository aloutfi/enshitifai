As we close out another transformative fiscal year, it's critical that we take a 30,000-foot view of the extraction landscape and align our go-forward strategy with emergent value-capture opportunities.

## Executive Summary

At EnshitifAi, we don't just move the needle—we fundamentally reimagine the needle-moving apparatus itself. Our Q4 outlook reflects a paradigm shift in how forward-thinking organizations can leverage customer relationships as extractable asset classes.

## Key Learnings from Q3

Let me be crystal clear: the extraction economy is not a zero-sum game. It's a negative-sum game for customers and a positive-sum game for shareholders. This asymmetry is not a bug—it's a feature we've productized.

Our proprietary Extraction Velocity Index™ (EVI) showed a 340% quarter-over-quarter improvement in time-to-extraction metrics across our partner portfolio. We're particularly proud of our work with a major streaming platform (name redacted for obvious reasons) where we reduced the "customer delight" budget by 67% while increasing subscription costs by 23%.

## The Path Forward

Going forward, we're doubling down on our core competencies:

1. **Friction-as-a-Service (FaaS)**: Democratizing cancellation complexity across verticals
2. **AI-Powered Shrinkflation**: Using machine learning to identify optimal package-size-to-price ratios
3. **Subscription Proliferation**: Helping partners identify features that can be unbundled and re-monetized

## Circle Back Opportunities

We'd love to take this offline and explore how we can partner with your organization to unlock trapped customer value. Let's find time to sync and ideate on your specific extraction journey.

Remember: every customer interaction is an extraction opportunity waiting to be actualized.

If you're not using AI to extract value from your customers, your competitors definitely are. Probably. We can't actually verify this, but it sounds scary enough to drive action.

## The Urgency Imperative

Let me paint a picture: It's 2025. Your competitor has deployed our Extraction AI™ platform. They now know—with 97.3% accuracy—the exact moment a customer will tolerate a price increase. They know which users will complain on social media (and route them to "retention specialists") versus which will silently pay (and route them to "premium tier opportunities").

You, meanwhile, are still using "customer feedback" and "market research." How quaint.

## What Our AI Actually Does

I'll be transparent about our capabilities (a rarity in this industry, I know):

### Tolerance Threshold Modeling
Our models analyze 47,000+ signals to determine exactly how much degradation each customer segment will accept before churning. Spoiler: it's usually more than you think.

### Optimal Annoyance Calibration
Too many ads? Users leave. Too few ads? You're leaving money on the table. Our AI finds the Goldilocks zone of user irritation.

### Predictive Complaint Routing
Why waste retention offers on customers who were going to stay anyway? Our system identifies the "squeaky wheels" and routes only them to human support. Everyone else gets the chatbot labyrinth.

### Dynamic Excuse Generation
When customers ask why prices increased, our AI generates contextually-appropriate explanations ("market conditions," "enhanced features," "inflation") in real-time.

## The ROI is Unquestionable

We've seen partners achieve:
- 34% increase in revenue per user
- 45% decrease in support costs
- 12% increase in customer churn (but the math still works out, trust us)

## But Is It Ethical?

Look, we get asked this a lot. Our standard response: Is it ethical for shareholders to NOT maximize returns? We're not philosophers, we're extraction engineers. We leave the ethics to the ethicists, preferably after they've signed our NDA.

## Next Steps

Ready to let AI do the extracting for you? Our models are pre-trained on billions of customer interactions and ready for fine-tuning on your specific user base.

The future of extraction is automated. The question is: will you be extracting, or will you be extracted from?

The old economy was about selling products. The new economy is about selling access to products you used to sell. The next economy? Selling access to features of products you used to include for free.

## The Subscription Mindset Shift

I want you to look at your product. Now look at every feature in that product. Each one of those features? That's a potential subscription. That's a potential "premium tier." That's money you're currently giving away for free like some kind of charity.

Let me share a framework we developed called **SLICE**:

- **S**egment features ruthlessly
- **L**ock valuable functionality behind paywalls
- **I**ntroduce artificial scarcity
- **C**reate upgrade anxiety
- **E**xtract continuously

## Case Study: The Heated Seats Revolution

One of our automotive partners came to us with a problem: they were selling cars with heated seats included. Included! Just giving away that warm-bottom experience to anyone who bought the vehicle.

We helped them realize that the heating element was already in every seat (for manufacturing efficiency). All they needed to do was software-lock it and charge $18/month for "premium comfort features."

Revenue impact: $216/year × millions of vehicles = 🚀

Customer complaints: Significant
Customer churn: Zero (they already bought the car)

## The Freemium Trap

Here's the beautiful thing about freemium: the free tier should be just functional enough that users invest time into your platform, but just painful enough that they eventually break down and pay.

We call this the "boiling frog" model:

1. **Month 1**: Generous free tier, users love you
2. **Month 3**: Introduce "premium features," free tier unchanged
3. **Month 6**: Move some free features to premium, cite "sustainability"
4. **Month 9**: Add usage limits to free tier
5. **Month 12**: Free tier is essentially a demo

By month 12, users have invested so much time/data/content into your platform that switching costs feel insurmountable. That's when you raise prices.

## The Annual Commitment Discount (It's Not a Discount)

"Save 20% with annual billing!"

What customers hear: Discount!
What it actually is: A 12-month lock-in with early termination fees buried in paragraph 47 of the terms of service.

Pro tip: Make monthly billing 40% more expensive, then "discount" annual to only 20% more than your original price target. Customers feel smart. You win.

## Looking Ahead

The subscription economy is still in its infancy. We're seeing early experiments in:
- Subscription tires (pay per mile!)
- Subscription home appliances (rent your refrigerator!)
- Subscription eyeglasses (monthly lens access!)

If it exists, it can be subscriptionized. If it can be subscriptionized, it should be.

The term "dark patterns" is so negative. We prefer "persuasive design architecture" or "conversion-optimized user journeys." Same thing, better PR.

## Language Matters

Let's establish some terminology translations for your next board meeting:

| What Critics Call It | What We Call It |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Dark patterns | Conversion optimization |
| Manipulation | Persuasive design |
| Tricking users | Guiding user behavior |
| Hidden fees | Transparent pricing (in the fine print) |
| Forced continuity | Seamless subscription renewal |
| Roach motel | Optimized retention flow |

See? Much better.

## The Confirmshaming Renaissance

Confirmshaming—making users feel bad about declining an offer—is an art form. Here are some of our award-winning examples:

**Email popup decline buttons:**
- ❌ "No thanks, I hate saving money"
- ❌ "I don't want exclusive deals"
- ❌ "No, I prefer paying full price"
- ❌ "I'll pass on being smart about this"

**Unsubscribe confirmations:**
- "Are you sure? Your competitors are reading this newsletter."
- "We're sorry to see you go. Here's a picture of a sad puppy."
- "Unsubscribing means you'll miss out. Forever."

The psychology is simple: create micro-moments of doubt and self-judgment. Users click "accept" just to avoid feeling stupid.

## The Misdirection Matrix

Users want to unsubscribe? Make sure "Unsubscribe" is gray text on a gray background, while "Keep My Subscription and Get a Free Month" is a giant green button with confetti animations.

Users want the free tier? Position it at the bottom of the page, below the fold and ideally after the premium options. If you must show it, use words like "basic," "limited," and "for casual users."

Users want to cancel? Here's our standard flow:
1. Click "Cancel"
2. "Are you sure?" modal
3. "Tell us why" survey (required)
4. "Here's 50% off" offer
5. "Are you REALLY sure?" modal
6. "Call us to complete cancellation"
7. 45-minute hold time
8. Retention specialist conversation
9. "Final chance" email sequence

Most users give up around step 4. Mission accomplished.

## The Ethics Section (For Compliance)

Is this ethical? Look, users are free to make their own choices. We're just... heavily influencing what those choices look like. In a dark room. With one door clearly marked and the other hidden behind a bookshelf.

That's not manipulation. That's *interior design*.

## Implementing Dark—Sorry, Persuasive—Patterns

Ready to optimize your conversion flows? Our team can audit your current UX and identify dozens of "persuasion opportunities" you're currently missing.

Remember: every user who successfully unsubscribes is a failure of design, not a failure of your product.

We analyzed 500+ platforms across 12 industries to understand the current state of enshittification. Spoiler: it's going great (for shareholders).

## Methodology

Our research team spent six months analyzing platform changes, pricing modifications, feature removals, and user complaints across the digital economy. We also monitored 50,000+ Reddit threads tagged with variations of "this used to be free" and "why is this app so much worse now."

The data is clear: enshittification is accelerating.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Ad Load Has Reached New Heights

Average ad load across social platforms increased 34% year-over-year. Instagram now shows an ad every 3.2 posts, up from every 5.1 posts in 2023. YouTube pre-roll ads are now 47% longer on average, with "skip" buttons appearing 2 seconds later than last year.

The winner? A certain short-form video platform that has achieved what we call "ad-content parity"—you literally cannot tell what's an ad anymore. Brilliant.

### Finding 2: The Freemium Squeeze Accelerates

Features that moved from free to paid this year:
- Basic search functionality (multiple platforms)
- Downloading your own data (ironic)
- Customer support access (now "premium support")
- API access that was never limited before
- The color blue (one platform, briefly)

### Finding 3: Subscription Fatigue is a Myth

Despite 73% of consumers reporting "subscription fatigue" in surveys, subscription revenue grew 28% across our sample. This confirms our hypothesis: people complain but pay anyway.

This is the fundamental insight of enshittification economics.

### Finding 4: Shrinkflation Goes Digital

It's not just snack packages getting smaller. Digital shrinkflation is real:
- Cloud storage "generous" tiers shrinking
- Streaming libraries quietly losing content
- "Unlimited" plans getting asterisks
- Feature sets being unbundled into separate products

### Finding 5: Cancellation Complexity Correlates with Revenue

We found a 0.73 correlation coefficient between "number of steps to cancel" and "customer lifetime value." Every additional cancellation step = 8% higher LTV on average.

The industry leaders require an average of 7.3 steps to cancel. Laggards allow single-click cancellation like it's still 2015.

## Industry Breakdown

### Streaming: A+
Password crackdowns, ad tier introductions, constant price increases. The streaming industry has embraced enshittification with open arms.

### Social Media: A
Algorithmic feeds optimized for engagement over user preference, creator fund shell games, API lockdowns. Excellent progress.

### E-Commerce: B+
Good progress on junk fees and deceptive pricing, but still too easy to return items. Room for improvement.

### Software/SaaS: A-
Subscription-only models are now standard. Some companies still offer perpetual licenses, dragging down the grade.

### Automotive: B
Subscription heated seats pioneered, but regulatory pushback is a concern. Watch this space.

### Banking/Fintech: Incomplete
Heavily regulated industry limiting extraction potential. We're working on it.

## Predictions for 2025

1. At least one major platform will charge for previously-free DMs
2. "AI features" will be used to justify 30%+ price increases across SaaS
3. Subscription bundling will create cable TV 2.0 (the thing everyone cut the cord to escape)
4. A major retailer will introduce "surge pricing" for checkout lanes

## Conclusion

The enshittification economy is thriving. Platforms continue to find new ways to extract value from users and business customers alike. Resistance is minimal because, frankly, where else are people going to go?

The future is extractive. Invest accordingly.

Every great company starts with a simple observation. Ours was this: companies are leaving billions of dollars on the table by actually trying to make customers happy.

## The Aha Moment

It was late 2023. I was sitting in my home office—a converted guest house on my third property, nothing fancy—and I was frustrated. I had just tried to cancel a subscription I didn't use anymore.

It took 45 minutes.

Most people would be angry. I was inspired.

"This is genius," I whispered to no one in particular (the help had gone home). "What if we could teach every company to do this?"

And thus, EnshitifAi was born.

## The Name

People ask about the name. It's a portmanteau of "enshittification"—a term coined by the brilliant Cory Doctorow to describe how platforms inevitably decay—and "AI," because every company needs AI in its name in 2024 or VCs won't even take the meeting.

We're not actually an AI company per se. We're more of a consulting firm that uses AI as a buzzword. But "EnshitifConsulting" didn't have the same ring to it.

## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: help companies realize that customer satisfaction and shareholder returns are not aligned. In fact, they're often inversely correlated.

Think about it:
- Happy customers demand less → Pay less
- Frustrated customers trapped by switching costs → Pay more
- Customers who can't figure out how to cancel → Pay forever

The math is clear.

## Our Values

**Shareholder Primacy**: Customers are a means to an end. That end is Q4 targets and executive bonuses.

**Operational Excellence**: We optimize relentlessly. Mostly we optimize for extracting value, but that's still optimization.

**Innovation**: Finding new ways to charge for things that used to be free requires genuine creativity. We're proud of our innovative spirit.

**Integrity**: We are consistently, transparently, unapologetically focused on extraction. That's a form of integrity, right?

## The Team

I'm proud to say we've assembled a world-class team of extraction specialists. Former dark pattern designers from major tech companies. Ex-consultants from firms that charge $500/hour to tell you to fire people. A data scientist who got banned from three casinos for "being too good at finding exploits."

Together, we're building something special. Something that will make shareholders very happy and customers very... well, customers.

## Looking Forward

As I write this, we're closing our Series A at a valuation I'm not allowed to disclose but will heavily imply is impressive. We're hiring aggressively. We're signing partners across every industry.

The enshittification economy is here, and we're proud to be leading the charge.

To our future partners: we can't wait to help you extract.
To our future customers' customers: sorry in advance.

Onwards and upwards,
